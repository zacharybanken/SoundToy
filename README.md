# SoundToy
A simple SwiftUI app using AudioKit for playing tones based on a user's finger position. The x-coordinate determines the frequency from 20Hz - 20kHz, and the y-coordinate determines the amplitude. The app plays 100 oscillators taken from the points on the drawn curve, which slowly fades away.
